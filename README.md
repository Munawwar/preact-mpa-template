# preact-mpa-template

Example repo to start a multi-page app/website (MPA) with Preact, express and esbuild. If you don't need server side rendering (SSR) check [preact-spa-template](https://github.com/Munawwar/preact-spa-template).

- <span aria-hidden>🐢</span> JS, CSS, image files are content hashed ("fingerprinted") on prod for long lived caching
- <span aria-hidden>🤵‍♂️</span> Express JS server
- <span aria-hidden>🔄</span> Live reload
- <span aria-hidden>✂️</span> Shared code chunks / Code splitting (read esbuild docs for caveats)
- <span aria-hidden>🚀</span> Preload shared chunks
- <span aria-hidden>🌐</span> Static files deployable to CDN

```sh
# Dev
npm run dev

# Prod
npm run build
npm run start
```

VSCode note: Install [es6-string-html](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Tobermory.es6-string-html) extension to syntax highlight HTML inside of JS template literals.

## Structure

Example server uses a config file for mapping URL pattern to server handling function. Config file is at `server/routes/routes.js`. This gives full flexibility on how routes and URLs are handled.

Entry files to a page should placed in `client/pages/{name}/{name}.page.jsx`.


You will have to do at least a couple of things to production-ize this template:
1. You may not want to have a single preact context for the entire website. Each page having a separate context might be better.
2. Add [HTTP/2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http2-express-bridge) support.
3. Optionally upload files from `dist/public` directory to a file storage origin (like AWS S3) and use a CDN to intercept everything under URL path `/public/*` (on the same domain as the express server) to point to the file storage origin. Enable dynamic compression on the CDN. If not that, then optionally add an express middleware for compression.
4. You might want a CSS solution like CSS modules or utility CSS (look into esbuild plugins for these)
